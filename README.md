# Herp Derp API

## Whut?

This takes text in, adds some herps and derps, and spits it back.
It's just an exercise.

This is written in node.  We're starting just as a command line thing.
Eventually I'd like to use this to test Express vs. Hapi vs. whatever 
else, possibly Go.

I also need to do a js test dealing with File IO and text parsing, so 
this seemed like the thing to do.
