The new arrow functions bring a helpful function syntax to ECMAScript,
but as with any new feature, they come with their own pitfalls and
gotchas.

Kyle Simpson, a JavaScript developer and writer, felt there were
enough pitfalls with Arrow Functions to warrant this flow chart when
deciding to use them. He argues there are too many confusing
rules/syntaxes with arrow functions. Others have suggested that using
arrow functions saves typing but ultimately makes code more difficult
to read. All those function and return statements might make it easier
to read multiple nested functions or just function expressions in
general.
