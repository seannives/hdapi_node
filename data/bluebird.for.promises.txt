It seems a bit odd to have ES6 promise support built into node.js and
have none of the built-in modules return promises. This needs to get
sorted out in node.js. Until then, I use Bluebird to promisify whole
libraries. So, it feels like promises are about 20% implemented in
node.js now since none of the built-in modules let you use promises
with them without manually wrapping them first.
